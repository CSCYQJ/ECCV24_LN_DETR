## Data
**NIH dataset**: The CT volumes are from the open-source NIH dataset, and available for download on the official [web-page](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ct-lymph-nodes/). The refined segmentations for all lymph nodes in 89 patients are available [here](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iVCnZc1GHwtx9scyAXdANqz2HdQArTHn). 

**Private dataset**: Our private dataset for lymph nodes detection including head & neck cancer, esophageal cancer patients, is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1weDKL9wCBPa9XJdag7LKnEHOFwCuyc7K?usp=sharing).
